This is my first IOT project using a microcontroller hardware
Keypad is interfaced with ESP-8266 where Blynk IOT is used to send email
ESP866 is used and in this code only 2 rows and 2 columns of the keypad are only enabled
I worked with this code during September 2022 and the code was copied from other source and i modified some parts of the code. This code is a ready made code for those who wants to use Blynk IOT where you can send email using Blynk and also at the same time based on the input it will generate whether the input is postitive or negative or false positive.
Unfortunately Blynk was updated to a never version perhaps this code won't work so you need some modification.
